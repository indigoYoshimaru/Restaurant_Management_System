# Simple Restaurant Management System

Aiming to make restaurant a safer place during the pandemic age, the team created a simple RMS using AdonisJs, VueJS, and Element. 

Assumming that the restaurant contains 3 actors: customers, kitchen staffs, and managers; each type of actors will be able to interact to perform 3 corresponding tasks: order food or drink, process the ordered items and combos and edit the menu's information.
